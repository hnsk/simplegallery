Step 10 in progress — `/web` web-root layout with originals served directly + recursive galleries.

Completed substeps:
1. **Config** — done. `Config(web_root, gallery_subdir)`; `source`/`output` derived. Env: `SIMPLEGALLERY_WEB`, `SIMPLEGALLERY_GALLERY_SUBDIR`. CLI: `--web`, `--gallery-subdir` added; legacy `--source`/`--output` kept transitionally. Reserved-name set + `direct_image_extensions` introduced. Tests in `tests/test_config.py`.
2. **Scanner** — done. New `DirectoryScanner.scan_tree()` returns recursive root `Gallery` (or `None`). `Gallery` gains `subgalleries`/`rel_path`/`breadcrumbs`/`subcount`/`walk()`. Reserved root-level names skipped + warned only at depth 0. Empty branches pruned. `MediaFile` gains `transcode_needed` + `original_rel`; tree-mode emits `output_full` only when transcode needed (HEIC/TIFF). Legacy flat `scan()` still works for builder/renderer/watcher until their substeps. Tests in `tests/test_scanner_tree.py` (15 cases).
3. **Cache** — done. `BuildCache(output, reserved_root_names=...)`; builder threads `Config.reserved_root_names` through. `prune` rewritten: walks galleries via `Gallery.walk()`, removes only cache-tracked orphan files, then rmdirs empty ancestor dirs upward, stopping at `output` and reserved top-levels (`gallery/`, `assets/`). Untracked dirs/files left alone. Tests rewritten in `tests/test_cache.py` (12 pass): nested-layout prune, untracked-orphan preservation, reserved-root collapse guard, shared-output protection.

Goal recap:
- Single mount: `/web`. User originals at `/web/<gallery_subdir>/` (default `gallery/`). Output (HTML + assets + thumbs + transcoded derivatives) at `/web/`.
- We own `/web/` root. User content outside `<gallery_subdir>/` = user error (skipped/ignored).
- Browser-friendly formats (jpg/jpeg/png/webp/gif/avif) → reference original directly as `data-src`; no full-size duplicate.
- HEIC/HEIF/TIFF → generate JPEG derivative for inline view, keep original downloadable via lightbox download button.
- Galleries nest arbitrarily. Each dir = its own page. Page layout: breadcrumbs → subgallery cards (own count + non-recursive subcount) → media grid. Empty galleries (no own media + no non-empty subs) skipped. Galleries with subs but no own media render text-only (no cover thumb).
- Reserved names at source root: `<gallery_subdir>`, `assets`, `index.html` — skip + warn on collision.

Decisions locked:
1. Cover for gallery with no own images: text only (no recursive cover).
2. Breadcrumbs: yes, on every gallery page.
3. Empty galleries: skip.
4. Subgallery card shows own media count + non-recursive subgallery count.
5. We own `/web/` root; user-supplied content lives only inside `<gallery_subdir>/`.

Next substep: **Image processor (10.4)** — `generate_full` only invoked when `transcode_needed` is true. Builder feeds the conditional `output_full` (already None for direct-served formats in tree mode). Document GPS-stays for direct-served formats since we don't strip from originals. Update `tests/test_image_processor.py` to cover the new gate.

Order of attack:
1. ~~Config (env + dataclass).~~ done
2. ~~Scanner (recursive, new `Gallery` shape, reserved names, transcode_needed flag on `MediaFile`).~~ done
3. ~~Cache (path-keyed verified; recursive-aware prune; reserved roots).~~ done
4. Image processor (skip `generate_full` when not transcode_needed).
5. Builder (DFS walk).
6. Renderer + templates (breadcrumbs, subgallery cards, original href, download button; drop separate index template).
7. Frontend (download button + subgallery + breadcrumb styling).
8. Watcher (per-dir dirty propagation under new layout).
9. CLI/`__main__` (drop legacy `--source`/`--output`).
10. docker-compose.yml.
11. Tests rewritten.
12. Smoke build over nested sample tree.

Per substep: update TODO.md + NEXT.md + commit.

How to reproduce so far:
- Build: `docker compose build app`
- Tests: `docker compose run --rm test` (96 pass; 1 known pre-Step-10 HEIC flake on `shelf-christmas-decoration.heic`)
- Smoke (current pre-Step-10 layout): `docker compose run --rm app -v` (will be replaced with `/web` layout in Step 10).
